   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare an Excel file named `portfolio_Analysis.xlsx` with the following sheets:
   - `Input`: Contains stock links and names.
   - `Input Columns`: Contains the data needed for scraping.
   - `New Output`: Contains the structure for the output data.

2. Run the script:
   ```sh

   ```

3. The script will scrape the data from screener.in and write the results to the `New Output` sheet in the Excel file.

## Detailed Explanation

### Input Excel File

- **Input Sheet**: This sheet should contain the URLs of the stock pages on screener.in and the names of the stocks.
- **Input Columns Sheet**: This sheet should specify the columns of data that need to be scraped.
- **New Output Sheet**: This sheet will be populated with the scraped data.

### Script Workflow

1. **Reading the Excel File**: The script reads the input Excel file using `pandas`.
2. **Mapping Sections**: It uses a dictionary to map specific sections to their corresponding IDs on the website.
3. **Scraping Data**: For each stock URL, the script sends a request to screener.in, parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup, and extracts the required data.
4. **Handling Missing Data**: If a section is not found, the script uses the original section name.
5. **Writing to Excel**: The extracted data is written back to the `New Output` sheet in the Excel file.

### Error Handling

- The script includes error handling for network issues, retrying the request if a connection fails.
- It also handles cases where the required data is not found on the webpage.

## Additional Information

- The script is designed to be easily modifiable. You can adjust the sections and data points to be scraped by updating the mappings and input columns.
- Ensure that the structure of the input Excel file matches the expected format for the script to work correctly.

Feel free to modify the script to suit your needs.
